- Read and understand the problem thoroughly.
- Brainstorm test cases.
  - Jot down starter test cases that you can think of based on an initial understanding of the problem.
  - List edge cases you need to account for to further solidify your understanding of the problem. Consider the following types of edge cases:
    - boundary conditions
    - overflows
    - null checks
    - duplicates
  - Group your test cases into multiple classes as you build out a strategy for solving the problem.
- Write the code.
- Perform a dry run using the test cases.
- Run the code and fix errors.

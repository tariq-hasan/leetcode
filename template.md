- Start by understanding the problem thoroughly.
- Jot down cases that you need to test for to solidify your understanding of the problem.
- List edge cases you need to account for to further solidify your understanding of the problem. Consider the following types of edge cases:
  - boundary conditions
  - overflows
  - null checks
  - duplicates
- Build a strategy for solving the problem. If the problem involves multiple classes of test cases, then make sure to list all of these cases.
- Write the code.
- Perform a dry run using the test cases.
- Run the code and fix errors.

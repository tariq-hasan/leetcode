# LeetCode 1547: Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick
#
# Problem: Given a wooden stick of length n units. The stick is labelled from 0 to n and has n+1 marks 
# at 0, 1, 2, ..., n. You are given an integer array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should 
# perform a cut at. You should perform the cuts in any order you like.
#
# The cost of a cut depends on the length of the stick segment being cut. For example, if the stick is 
# of length 10 and you cut it at position 5, the cost is 10. If you then cut the left piece at position 
# 2, the cost is 5. Return the minimum total cost of the cuts.

# Interview strategy and common patterns
def interview_strategy():
    """
    Interview Approach for Interval DP Problems:
    
    1. **Problem Recognition** (1-2 mins):
       - Keywords: "optimal order", "interval", "cuts", "minimum cost"
       - Pattern: Cost depends on current state, decisions affect future costs
       - This is classic Interval DP (like Matrix Chain Multiplication)
    
    2. **State Definition** (2-3 mins):
       - What represents a subproblem? â†’ Interval [i, j]
       - What do we need to track? â†’ Minimum cost to make all cuts in interval
       - Boundaries: Add 0 and n to cuts array
    
    3. **Recurrence Relation** (3-4 mins):
       - Try each cut as the "last" cut in current interval
       - Cost = current_length + cost(left_part) + cost(right_part)
       - Base case: no cuts possible between adjacent positions
    
    4. **Implementation Choice** (1-2 mins):
       - Top-down (memoization) is usually more intuitive
       - Bottom-up if you want to show mastery of both approaches
    
    5. **Complexity Analysis** (1-2 mins):
       - Time: O(mÂ³) where m = number of cuts
       - Space: O(mÂ²) for memoization/DP table
    
    6. **Testing and Edge Cases** (2-3 mins):
       - Single cut, no cuts, cuts at boundaries
       - Verify with small example
    
    Key Interview Points:
    - This is similar to Matrix Chain Multiplication
    - The "trick" is thinking about which cut to make LAST
    - Adding boundaries (0, n) simplifies the implementation
    - Always sort the cuts array first
    
    Common Mistakes:
    - Not adding boundary points
    - Forgetting to sort cuts
    - Wrong recurrence (trying first cut instead of last cut)
    - Off-by-one errors in indices

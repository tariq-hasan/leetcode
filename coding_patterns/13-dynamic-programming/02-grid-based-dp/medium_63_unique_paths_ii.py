LeetCode 63: Unique Paths II

Problem Statement:
You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at 
the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right 
corner (i.e., grid[m-1][n-1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any 
point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 and 0 respectively in grid. A path that the 
robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the 
bottom-right corner.

Constraints:
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- grid[i][j] is 0 or 1

Examples:
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1

Input: obstacleGrid = [[1]]
Output: 0

Input: obstacleGrid = [[0]]
Output: 1

INTERVIEW DISCUSSION POINTS:

1. Problem Recognition:
   - Extension of Unique Paths I with obstacles
   - Still a 2D grid traversal problem with DP
   - Key difference: obstacles (1) block paths, empty spaces (0) allow movement
   - Cannot pass through or count paths through obstacles

2. Approach Evolution (Show this progression):
   
   a) Understand Base Problem:
      - Same as Unique Paths I: only right/down movement
      - dp[i][j] = number of paths to reach cell (i,j)
   
   b) Handle Obstacles:
      - If cell has obstacle: dp[i][j] = 0 (no paths through obstacles)
      - If cell is empty: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
   
   c) Base Cases with Obstacles:
      - First row: paths blocked after first obstacle
      - First column: paths blocked after first obstacle
      - Starting point: if blocked, return 0 immediately

3. Key DP Insights:
   - State definition: dp[i][j] = number of paths to reach (i,j) avoiding obstacles
   - Base cases: Handle first row/column carefully with obstacles
   - Recurrence: Same as Unique Paths I, but with obstacle check
   - Obstacles act as "path blockers" - set dp value to 0

4. Critical Edge Cases:
   - Starting point (0,0) is blocked â†’ return 0
   - Destination is blocked â†’ return 0
   - Path completely blocked by obstacles â†’ return 0
   - No obstacles â†’ same as original Unique Paths problem
   - Single cell with/without obstacle

5. Implementation Variations:
   
   a) 2D DP Array (Most Intuitive):
      - Separate DP table, clear logic
      - Easy to understand and debug
   
   b) Space-Optimized (1D Array):
      - Only need previous row for current row
      - O(n) space instead of O(m*n)
   
   c) In-Place Modification:
      - Use input grid as DP table
      - O(1) extra space but modifies input
   
   d) Recursive + Memoization:
      - Top-down approach
      - Good for showing recursion understanding

6. Obstacle Handling Strategy:
   - Check for obstacle BEFORE computing paths
   - Obstacles propagate blocking effect in first row/column
   - Obstacles in middle only affect that specific cell

7. Follow-up Questions You Might Get:
   - "What if robot can move in all 4 directions?" â†’ Different problem (shortest path)
   - "What if obstacles can be removed?" â†’ State becomes (i,j,obstacles_removed)
   - "What if we want the actual paths?" â†’ Backtracking needed
   - "What about minimum cost path?" â†’ Different DP state (cost instead of count)

8. Interview Strategy:
   - Start by comparing to Unique Paths I
   - Identify key difference: obstacles block paths
   - Implement 2D DP first (most clear)
   - Optimize space if time permits
   - Test with edge cases, especially obstacle at start/end

9. Common Mistakes to Avoid:
   - Not checking if starting point is blocked
   - Incorrect handling of first row/column with obstacles
   - Forgetting that obstacles completely block paths (set to 0)
   - Index out of bounds when checking neighbors
   - Not handling empty grid or single cell cases

10. Complexity Analysis:
    - Time: O(m * n) - visit each cell once
    - Space: O(m * n) for 2D DP, O(n) for optimized, O(1) for in-place
    - Same time complexity as Unique Paths I, but with obstacle checks

11. Testing Strategy:
    - Normal cases with obstacles in middle
    - Edge cases: start/end blocked, path completely blocked
    - Compare with Unique Paths I (when no obstacles)
    - Single row/column with obstacles

INTERVIEW STRATEGY & KEY POINTS:

1. PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING:
   - Find number of paths that sum to targetSum
   - Paths can start and end at ANY nodes (not just root to leaf)
   - Path must go downward (parent to child direction)
   - Can include negative numbers
   - Multiple paths can have same sum

2. NAIVE APPROACH (mention but don't implement as primary):
   - For each node, try all paths starting from that node: O(nÂ²)
   - "While this works, I can do much better with prefix sum technique"

3. OPTIMAL APPROACH - KEY INSIGHTS:

   INSIGHT 1: Prefix Sum Pattern
   - Track cumulative sum from root to current node
   - If (current_sum - target) exists in our history, we found valid path(s)
   - This is similar to "Two Sum" but for tree paths

   INSIGHT 2: HashMap for O(1) Lookups
   - Store frequency of each prefix sum seen so far
   - Multiple paths can have same prefix sum (hence frequency count)

   INSIGHT 3: Backtracking Pattern
   - Add current sum when entering subtree
   - Remove current sum when leaving subtree (backtrack)
   - This ensures we don't count cross-subtree paths

4. ALGORITHM WALKTHROUGH:
   - Maintain running sum from root to current node
   - Check if (current_sum - target) exists in prefix sum map
   - Add current_sum to map before recursing
   - Recurse on children
   - Remove current_sum from map (backtrack)

5. WHY PREFIX SUM WORKS:
   - If we have prefix_sum[i] and prefix_sum[j] where j > i
   - Then sum from i+1 to j = prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i]
   - We want this to equal target, so prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[j] - target

6. CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
   - Initialize map with {0: 1} for paths starting from root
   - Use defaultdict or handle missing keys carefully
   - Backtrack by decrementing count (not deleting) to handle duplicates
   - Handle negative numbers correctly

7. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
   - Time: O(n) - visit each node once, O(1) hashmap operations
   - Space: O(h) for recursion stack + O(h) for hashmap = O(h)
   - Much better than O(nÂ²) brute force!

8. EDGE CASES:
   - Empty tree â 0
   - Single node matching target â 1
   - All negative numbers
   - Target is 0 (tricky with prefix sum logic)
   - Multiple paths with same sum

9. COMPARISON TO RELATED PROBLEMS:
   - Path Sum I (112): boolean, root to leaf only
   - Path Sum II (113): all paths, root to leaf only  
   - Path Sum III (437): count paths, any start/end but downward only
   - Path Sum IV (666): different tree representation

10. INTERVIEW PRESENTATION:
    - Start with: "I'll use prefix sum technique like in subarray problems"
    - Explain the key insight: current_sum - target lookup
    - Emphasize the backtracking for tree traversal
    - Code the optimal solution
    - Walk through example showing prefix sum evolution

11. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
    - "What if paths can go upward too?" â Much harder, need different approach
    - "What if we want actual paths?" â Need to track path segments
    - "What about very wide trees?" â Discuss space complexity of hashmap
    - "Can you do it iteratively?" â Yes, but more complex

12. WHY THIS IS BRILLIANT:
    - Reduces O(nÂ²) problem to O(n) using auxiliary space
    - Leverages well-known prefix sum pattern
    - Clean recursive structure with backtracking
    - Handles all edge cases naturally

13. COMMON MISTAKES:
    - Forgetting to initialize prefix_sum[0] = 1
    - Not backtracking properly (affects sibling subtrees)
    - Using wrong data structure (need frequency count, not just set)
    - Misunderstanding the prefix sum math

14. KEY INSIGHT TO ARTICULATE:
    "This problem is essentially finding subarrays with target sum, but on 
    tree paths instead of arrays. I can use the same prefix sum technique: 
    if I've seen prefix_sum - target before, then there's a valid path 
    ending at the current node. The key difference is backtracking when 
    leaving subtrees to ensure I don't count invalid cross-subtree paths."

15. IMPLEMENTATION CHOICE:
    - Lead with the clean recursive solution with defaultdict
    - It's elegant and shows mastery of both tree traversal and prefix sum
    - Mention brute force for comparison but don't implement as primary
    - Show iterative version only if specifically requested

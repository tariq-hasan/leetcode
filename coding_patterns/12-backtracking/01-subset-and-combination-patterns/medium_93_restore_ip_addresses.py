# INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS AND STRATEGY
interview_guide = """
INTERVIEW WALKTHROUGH (6-8 minutes total):

1. PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING (1 minute):
   "I need to split a string into 4 parts that form a valid IP address."
   "Valid IP constraints: each part 0-255, no leading zeros except '0' itself."
   "I cannot reorder digits, only choose where to split."

2. APPROACH EXPLANATION (1 minute):
   "This is a classic backtracking problem."
   "I'll try all possible ways to split the string into 4 segments."
   "For each position, I can try segments of length 1, 2, or 3."
   "I'll validate each segment and backtrack if invalid."

3. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (3 minutes):
   - Helper function to validate IP segments
   - Recursive function with backtracking
   - Base case: 4 segments formed, check if all characters used
   - Pruning: early termination for impossible cases

4. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS (1 minute):
   "Time: O(3^4) = O(81) - constant since at most 3 choices per segment, 4 segments"
   "Space: O(4) = O(1) for recursion depth"
   "The constant factor makes this essentially O(1) time and space."

5. OPTIMIZATION DISCUSSION (1 minute):
   "Early pruning based on string length (must be 4-12 characters)"
   "Stop trying longer segments once we exceed 255"
   "Could use iterative approach with 3 nested loops"

KEY POINTS TO MENTION:
âœ“ Validate segments carefully (leading zeros, range 0-255)
âœ“ Backtracking pattern with proper cleanup
âœ“ Early termination/pruning for efficiency
âœ“ Handle edge cases (too short/long strings)

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
âœ— Forgetting to check leading zeros
âœ— Not validating segment length (max 3 digits)
âœ— Not handling the "0" case properly
âœ— Forgetting to backtrack (remove segment from path)
âœ— Not checking if all characters are used

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- "What if we wanted IPv6?" â†’ Similar approach, different validation
- "How would you optimize further?" â†’ Discuss iterative vs recursive trade-offs
- "What about invalid characters?" â†’ Add character validation
"""

# COMMON EDGE CASES TO DISCUSS
edge_cases_explanation = """
CRITICAL EDGE CASES TO HANDLE:

1. Leading Zeros:
   - "01" is invalid (but "0" is valid)
   - "001" is invalid
   - Must check: len(segment) > 1 and segment[0] == '0'

2. Out of Range:
   - "256" is invalid (> 255)
   - Must check: int(segment) <= 255

3. String Length:
   - < 4 characters: impossible (need at least "1.1.1.1")
   - > 12 characters: impossible (max is "255.255.255.255")

4. Boundary Cases:
   - "0000" â†’ "0.0.0.0" (valid)
   - "1111" â†’ "1.1.1.1" (valid)
   - "12345" â†’ multiple valid splits possible

5. Empty Segments:
   - Never generate empty segments in proper backtracking
   - But good to validate in helper function

        - We need slow to point to the node BEFORE the one to remove

INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS:

1. PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
   "We need to remove the nth node from the END of the list"
   "Key challenge: we don't know the length in advance"
   "Need to handle edge case of removing the first node"

2. TWO-POINTER APPROACH (PREFERRED):
   "Use two pointers with a gap of n+1 positions"
   "Why n+1? We need slow to point to the node BEFORE the target"
   "Move fast pointer n+1 steps first, then move both together"

3. DUMMY NODE PATTERN:
   "Dummy node simplifies the edge case of removing first node"
   "Without dummy: need special handling for head removal"
   "With dummy: uniform logic for all removals"

4. STEP-BY-STEP WALKTHROUGH:
   List: [1,2,3,4,5], n=2 (remove 4)
   
   Initial: dummy->1->2->3->4->5, slow=dummy, fast=dummy
   Step 1: Move fast 3 positions: fast points to 3
   Step 2: Move both until fast reaches end:
           slow=1, fast=4
           slow=2, fast=5
           slow=3, fast=null
   Step 3: slow.next.next removes 4: 1->2->3->5

5. EDGE CASES:
   - Remove first node (n equals list length)
   - Single node list
   - Remove last node
   - Empty list (though constraints usually prevent this)

6. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
   - Two-pass: Calculate length first, then find target
   - Stack: Push all nodes, pop n times
   - Recursive: Count backwards while returning

7. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
   - Two-pointer: O(L) time, O(1) space âœ… (optimal)
   - Two-pass: O(L) time, O(1) space (but 2 passes)
   - Stack: O(L) time, O(L) space
   - Recursive: O(L) time, O(L) space (call stack)

8. WHY TWO-POINTER IS PREFERRED:
   - Single pass through the list
   - Constant extra space
   - Handles all edge cases elegantly with dummy node
   - Clean, readable code

9. COMMON MISTAKES:
   - Using gap of n instead of n+1 (points to wrong node)
   - Forgetting dummy node (complex first node handling)
   - Not handling edge case of removing first node
   - Off-by-one errors in counting

10. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
    - "What if n is invalid (> list length)?" â†’ Add validation
    - "Remove nth node from start instead?" â†’ Simpler problem
    - "Remove multiple nodes from end?" â†’ Extend the algorithm
    - "What about doubly-linked lists?" â†’ Easier with prev pointers

INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS:

1. APPROACH SELECTION:
   - Start with iterative (most common in interviews)
   - Mention recursive as alternative
   - Stack solution shows different thinking

2. KEY INSIGHTS:
   - Need to keep track of previous node to reverse links
   - Careful not to lose nodes when changing pointers
   - Three pointers: prev, curr, next_temp

3. STEP-BY-STEP WALKTHROUGH:
   Original: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
   Step 1:   NULL <- 1    2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
   Step 2:   NULL <- 1 <- 2    3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
   Step 3:   NULL <- 1 <- 2 <- 3    4 -> 5 -> NULL
   Step 4:   NULL <- 1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4    5 -> NULL
   Step 5:   NULL <- 1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4 <- 5

4. EDGE CASES:
   - Empty list (return None)
   - Single node (return as is)
   - Two nodes (simple swap)

5. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
   - Iterative: O(n) time, O(1) space âœ…
   - Recursive: O(n) time, O(n) space (stack)
   - Stack: O(n) time, O(n) space

6. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
   - "Can you do it recursively?"
   - "Reverse in groups of k nodes?"
   - "Reverse between positions m and n?"
   - "How would you test this?"

7. IMPLEMENTATION TIPS:
   - Always handle edge cases first
   - Draw out the pointer movements
   - Test with multiple cases
   - Consider both iterative and recursive

LeetCode 1846. Maximum Element After Decreasing and Rearranging

Problem: You are given an array of positive integers arr. Perform some operations 
(possibly none) on arr so that it satisfies these conditions:
1. The value of the first element in arr must be 1.
2. The absolute difference between any two adjacent elements must be at most 1.
3. You can decrease any element to any smaller positive value.
4. You can rearrange the elements of arr in any order.

Return the maximum possible value of an element in arr after performing the operations.

Key Insights:
1. We want to maximize the largest element while satisfying constraints
2. Sorting helps us build the optimal sequence greedily
3. Each position has a maximum possible value based on previous elements
4. Greedy approach: make each element as large as possible given constraints

Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting
Space Complexity: O(1) if sorting in-place, O(n) otherwise

Critical Interview Discussion Points:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Can decrease any element (but not increase)
   - Can rearrange elements in any order
   - First element must be 1
   - Adjacent elements can differ by at most 1
   - Goal: maximize the largest element

2. **Key Insights**:
   - Sorting allows us to build optimal sequence greedily
   - Each position has a maximum achievable value
   - Greedy choice: make each element as large as possible
   - Mathematical bound: maximum possible value is min(max(arr), n)

3. **Why Greedy Works**:
   - At each step, choosing maximum possible value is locally optimal
   - This leads to globally optimal solution
   - Any larger choice violates constraints
   - Any smaller choice is suboptimal

4. **Algorithm Steps**:
   1. Sort array to process elements in ascending order
   2. Set first element to 1 (required constraint)
   3. For each subsequent element, set to min(original_value, prev_value + 1)
   4. Return the last element (maximum)

5. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - Time: O(n log n) due to sorting (optimal for comparison-based)
   - Space: O(1) if sorting in-place, O(n) for copy
   - Could optimize to O(n + k) with counting sort if values are small

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single element: always returns 1
   - All large elements: limited by array length
   - Already optimal sequence: no changes needed
   - Reverse sorted: demonstrates the algorithm working

7. **Mathematical Properties**:
   - Maximum possible value is bounded by array length
   - Sequence must form: 1, 2, 3, ..., k for some k â‰¤ n
   - Each element contributes at most 1 to the maximum increase

8. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Could use dynamic programming (overkill)
   - Could try all permutations (exponential time)
   - Greedy is both simple and optimal

9. **Follow-up Questions**:
   - What if we could increase elements? (different problem)
   - What if constraint was difference â‰¤ k instead of 1?
   - How would you handle negative numbers?

10. **Implementation Tips**:
    - Sort first (crucial for greedy strategy)
    - Handle first element specially (must be 1)
    - Use min() to respect both constraints (original value and adjacency)
    - Return last element after processing (maximum value)

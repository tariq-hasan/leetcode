LeetCode 1020. Number of Enclaves
Problem: You are given an m x n binary matrix grid, where 0 represents a sea cell and 1 represents a land cell.
A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally) land cell or walking off the boundary of the grid.
Return the number of land cells in grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.

Examples:
- Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,1],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
  Output: 3 (the middle land cells cannot reach boundary)

Key insight: Land cells that can reach boundary are NOT enclaves.
Strategy: Mark all land cells connected to boundary, then count remaining land cells.

INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS:

1. PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING:
   - "Enclaves are land cells that cannot reach the boundary"
   - "Strategy: Find all land cells connected to boundary, count the rest"
   - "This is essentially a graph connectivity problem"

2. START WITH DFS FROM BOUNDARY (PREFERRED):
   - "Start DFS from all boundary land cells"
   - "Mark all reachable land cells (these can escape)"
   - "Count remaining unmarked land cells (these are enclaves)"
   - Time: O(m*n), Space: O(m*n) for recursion stack

3. KEY INSIGHTS:
   - "Instead of checking if each cell can reach boundary, we reverse the approach"
   - "Start from boundary and mark all reachable cells - much more efficient"
   - "This avoids redundant DFS calls from interior cells"

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
   - "Can modify grid in-place (set reachable land to 0) or use visited set"
   - "Need to handle all 4 boundary sides: top, bottom, left, right"
   - "Be careful with corner cells - don't double-count"

5. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
   - BFS: "Same logic but iterative - good if worried about stack overflow"
   - Union-Find: "Advanced approach connecting land cells to virtual boundary node"
   - Two-pass: "More explicit separation of marking and counting phases"

6. EDGE CASES:
   - Empty grid or no land cells â return 0
   - All land cells on boundary â return 0  
   - Grid with single row/column â handle boundary correctly
   - All land cells are enclaves â count all

7. OPTIMIZATION DISCUSSIONS:
   - "Can use BFS instead of DFS to avoid stack overflow for large grids"
   - "In-place modification saves space but destroys original grid"
   - "Union-Find has worse time complexity but shows advanced knowledge"

8. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
   - "What if we want to preserve original grid?" â Use visited set
   - "How to handle very large grids?" â BFS to avoid stack overflow
   - "What if we want to find actual enclave regions?" â Return list of coordinates

RECOMMENDED INTERVIEW FLOW:
1. Clarify problem: "Find land cells that cannot reach boundary"
2. Explain strategy: "Reverse approach - start from boundary, mark reachable"
3. Code DFS solution with boundary traversal
4. Test with example grid
5. Discuss time/space complexity: O(m*n) for both
6. Mention BFS alternative if asked about stack overflow
7. Handle edge cases

KEY INSIGHT TO COMMUNICATE:
"Instead of checking each cell individually, we reverse the problem: start from the boundary and mark everything reachable. What's left unmarked are the enclaves."

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
- Forgetting to check all 4 boundary sides
- Double-counting corner cells
- Not handling empty grid edge case
- Stack overflow with deep recursion (mention BFS alternative)
- Off-by-one errors in boundary iteration

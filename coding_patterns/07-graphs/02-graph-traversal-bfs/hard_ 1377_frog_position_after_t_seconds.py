LeetCode 1377: Frog Position After T Seconds

Problem Statement:
Given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 1 to n. 
A frog starts jumping from vertex 1. In one second, the frog jumps from its 
current vertex to another unvisited vertex if they are directly connected. 
The frog cannot jump back to a visited vertex. In case the frog can jump to 
several vertices, it jumps randomly to one of them with the same probability. 
If the frog cannot jump to any unvisited vertex, it stays at the current vertex forever.

Return the probability that after t seconds the frog is on the vertex target.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 100
- edges.length == n - 1
- edges[i].length == 2
- 1 <= ai, bi <= n
- 1 <= t <= 50
- 1 <= target <= n

Key Rules:
1. Frog starts at vertex 1
2. Can only jump to unvisited vertices
3. If multiple choices, equal probability for each
4. If no unvisited neighbors, stays forever at current vertex
5. Cannot revisit vertices

Examples:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 2, target = 4
Output: 0.16666666666666666
Explanation: The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 probability to vertex 2 
after second 1 and then jumping with 1/2 probability to vertex 4 after second 2.
Thus the probability = 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6 â‰ˆ 0.16667

Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 1, target = 7
Output: 0.3333333333333333
Explanation: After 1 second, frog has 1/3 probability to be at vertex 7.

"""
INTERVIEW DISCUSSION POINTS:

1. Problem Understanding:
   - Tree structure (n-1 edges, no cycles)
   - Frog starts at vertex 1
   - Cannot revisit vertices
   - Equal probability when multiple choices
   - Stays forever when no unvisited neighbors

2. Key Insights:
   - BFS naturally models time progression (level = second)
   - Probability calculation: current_prob / number_of_choices
   - Two stopping conditions: no unvisited neighbors OR time runs out
   - Critical case: frog reaches target but still has time and neighbors

3. Algorithm Choice:
   - BFS is optimal for this time-based simulation
   - DFS can work but is more complex to reason about
   - Level-by-level processing matches the problem's time constraint

4. Edge Cases:
   - Single node tree (n=1)
   - Target is starting vertex (vertex 1)
   - Target unreachable within time limit
   - Frog reaches target but must move away (has unvisited neighbors and time left)
   - Leaf node targets (frog stays forever once reached)

5. Probability Calculation:
   - Start with probability 1.0 at vertex 1
   - At each step, divide probability by number of unvisited neighbors
   - Accumulate probabilities for paths leading to target

6. Implementation Details:
   - Use adjacency list for tree representation
   - Track visited vertices to avoid cycles
   - Handle parent-child relationship (subtract 1 from neighbor count for non-root)
   - Queue stores (vertex, probability) pairs

7. Complexity Analysis:
   - Time: O(t * n) - process at most min(t, n) levels, each level processes O(n) vertices
   - Space: O(n) - adjacency list, queue, and visited array

8. Follow-up Questions:
   - What if frog could revisit vertices?
   - What if different edges had different probabilities?
   - How to handle multiple frogs?
   - What if we wanted all probabilities after t seconds?

9. Common Mistakes:
   - Forgetting that frog must move if it has unvisited neighbors and time
   - Not handling the parent-child relationship correctly
   - Miscalculating probability distribution
   - Not considering the "stays forever" rule

LeetCode 1254. Number of Closed Islands
Problem: Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water), an island is a group of 1s 
(representing water) and is surrounded by 0s (representing land). An island is closed if the 
island is completely surrounded by water (1s) and is not touching the boundary of the grid.
Return the number of closed islands.

Wait - there's a common confusion here! Let me clarify:
Actually, in this problem:
- 0 represents LAND
- 1 represents WATER  
- A closed island is a group of 0s (land) completely surrounded by 1s (water)
- Islands touching the boundary are NOT closed

Examples:
- Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
  Output: 2 (there are 2 closed islands of land)

Key insight: Remove all land connected to boundary first, then count remaining land islands.

"""
INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS:

1. PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING (CRITICAL - CLARIFY FIRST):
   - "Let me confirm: 0 = land, 1 = water, we want closed land islands"
   - "Closed island = land completely surrounded by water, not touching boundary"
   - "This is opposite of typical island problems where 1 = land"

2. START WITH BOUNDARY REMOVAL DFS (PREFERRED):
   - "Strategy: Remove all land connected to boundary, count remaining islands"
   - "Two phases: 1) Eliminate boundary-connected land, 2) Count remaining islands"
   - "More efficient than checking each island individually"
   - Time: O(m*n), Space: O(m*n) for recursion stack

3. KEY INSIGHTS:
   - "Any land touching boundary cannot be a closed island"
   - "Reverse approach: eliminate invalid islands first, then count valid ones"
   - "Similar to 'Number of Enclaves' but counting islands instead of cells"

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
   - "First DFS: start from boundary, mark all connected land as water"
   - "Second pass: standard island counting on remaining land"
   - "Can modify grid in-place or use visited sets"

5. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
   - Boolean DFS: "Check if each island touches boundary during traversal"
   - BFS: "Same logic but iterative - good for stack overflow concerns"
   - Union-Find: "Advanced approach using virtual boundary node"

6. EDGE CASES:
   - Empty grid â return 0
   - All water â return 0
   - All land touching boundary â return 0
   - Single cell grids â check if it's boundary

7. COMMON CONFUSION POINTS:
   - "Remember: 0=land, 1=water (opposite of typical problems)"
   - "Closed means NOT touching boundary (completely surrounded)"
   - "Count islands, not individual land cells"

8. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
   - "How to preserve original grid?" â Use visited set approach
   - "What about very large grids?" â BFS to avoid stack overflow
   - "How to find actual island coordinates?" â Return list of island cell sets

RECOMMENDED INTERVIEW FLOW:
1. **CLARIFY PROBLEM FIRST**: "Just to confirm, 0=land, 1=water, and we want land islands not touching boundary?"
2. Explain strategy: "Remove boundary-connected land first, then count remaining islands"
3. Code two-phase DFS solution
4. Test with example (trace through boundary removal, then counting)
5. Discuss complexity: O(m*n) time and space
6. Handle edge cases and mention alternatives

KEY INSIGHT TO COMMUNICATE:
"The key insight is that any land connected to the boundary cannot be closed. So we eliminate all boundary-connected land first, then count the remaining separate land components."

CRITICAL INTERVIEW MISTAKE TO AVOID:
- **Misunderstanding the problem**: This is the #1 issue. Make sure you clarify that 0=land, 1=water
- Many candidates assume 1=land and get completely wrong approach

COMMON CODING MISTAKES:
- Forgetting to handle all 4 boundary sides
- Not properly implementing two-phase approach
- Off-by-one errors in boundary traversal
- Confusing land (0) vs water (1) in conditions

LeetCode 1559. Detect Cycles in 2D Grid
Problem: Given a 2D array of characters grid of size m x n, you need to find if there exists any cycle 
consisting of the same value in grid.

A cycle is a path of length 4 or more in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. 
From a cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, right), 
if it has the same value of the current cell.

Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in the previous move.

Examples:
- Input: grid = [["a","a","a","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","a","a","a"]]
  Output: true (there's a cycle of 'a's around the border)
  
- Input: grid = [["c","c","c","a"],["c","d","c","c"],["c","c","e","c"],["f","c","c","c"]]
  Output: true (there's a cycle of 'c's)

Key insights: 
1. This is cycle detection in an undirected graph
2. Cannot revisit the parent cell (immediate previous cell)
3. Need DFS with parent tracking
4. Cycle exists if we reach a visited cell that's not our parent

"""
INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS:

1. PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING:
   - "This is cycle detection in an undirected graph represented as a 2D grid"
   - "Each cell is a node, edges exist between adjacent cells with same character"
   - "Key constraint: cannot return to immediate parent (previous cell)"
   - "Minimum cycle length is 4 due to grid structure"

2. START WITH DFS + PARENT TRACKING (PREFERRED):
   - "Use DFS to explore connected components of same characters"
   - "Track parent to avoid immediate backtracking"
   - "Cycle found when we reach a visited cell that's not our parent"
   - Time: O(m*n), Space: O(m*n) for visited array and recursion

3. KEY INSIGHTS:
   - "This is different from directed graph cycle detection"
   - "Must prevent immediate backtracking to parent"
   - "Each connected component of same characters forms a subgraph"
   - "Only need to find one cycle to return true"

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
   - "For each unvisited cell, start DFS with that character"
   - "Pass parent coordinates to avoid going back"
   - "If we reach visited cell (not parent), cycle found"
   - "Use directions array for clean 4-directional movement"

5. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
   - Union-Find: "Connect same-character neighbors, cycle when union fails"
   - BFS: "Same logic as DFS but iterative - good for stack overflow concerns"
   - Color states: "WHITE/GRAY/BLACK coloring for cycle detection"

6. EDGE CASES:
   - Single cell grid â False (minimum cycle length is 4)
   - All different characters â False
   - 2x2 grid of same character â True (forms a 4-cycle)
   - Linear path â False

7. OPTIMIZATION DISCUSSIONS:
   - "Can early terminate as soon as we find one cycle"
   - "Union-Find has worse time complexity but elegant for this problem"
   - "BFS alternative if recursion depth is a concern"

8. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
   - "What's minimum cycle length?" â 4 due to grid structure and parent constraint
   - "How to find all cycles?" â Continue search instead of early return
   - "What about diagonal movement?" â Would change minimum cycle length to 3

RECOMMENDED INTERVIEW FLOW:
1. Clarify problem: "Find cycle of same characters, can't return to immediate parent"
2. Explain approach: "DFS with parent tracking for cycle detection"
3. Code DFS solution with clean parent handling
4. Test with example: trace through DFS showing cycle detection
5. Discuss complexity: O(m*n) time and space
6. Mention alternatives: Union-Find, BFS, color states
7. Handle edge cases

KEY INSIGHT TO COMMUNICATE:
"This is undirected graph cycle detection where we must track the parent to prevent immediate backtracking. The key is recognizing when we reach a visited cell that's not our immediate parent."

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
- Forgetting parent tracking (allowing immediate backtrack)
- Not handling bounds checking properly
- Confusing with directed graph cycle detection
- Forgetting that minimum cycle length is 4
- Not checking character equality before moving

CRITICAL INTERVIEW POINTS:
- "Cannot return to immediate parent" - this is the key constraint
- "Each connected component of same characters is a separate subgraph"
- "DFS with parent tracking is most intuitive approach"
- "Union-Find also works elegantly - when union fails, cycle exists"
